Hello, I performed an approximately 10-day travel from 2024/06/19 to 2024/06/29 starting in USA , travelling to South Korea and Japan, and ending in USA.

Here is a description of what I did and saw and ate during this trip. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact me. Also please do not load this page if you have limited mobile data or the like because its really big and has lots of media. Thank you, and have a nice day

# day 0: background and preparation

I am is was some sort of south-korean global pop sensation NewJeans enthusiast. And it was they hold large concert in Japan on 2024/06/26,27. Thus I believe this concert can be seen as the main, definite reason that took this trip. However it could also be seen that the primary reason take trip was simply I wanted to take a summer trip, and concert was a coincidence.

But after securing concert tickets (lottery), I believe trip planning did center around Seeing Concert. Thus, before i took trip this was approx my planned trip plans:

- go to korea
- eat meal with friend who said probably can eat meal together in korea
- ???
- go from korea -> japan
- ???
- concert
- ???
- go to USA

as you can see, the only main two events are "eat meal with friend" and "concert".

i did not know what else would do in korea or japan. For my trip planning, simply I bought two plane bookings:

1. IAD -> YYZ -> ICN (USA to Korea)
2. KIX -> YVR -> IAD (Japan to USA)

and not an booking from Korea to Japan since idk what i would do in korea and japan, and since bookings from korea to japan is honestly not that expensive i think and i felt no need to book ahead of time.

The supplies I packed for the trip was as following:

![supplies](TZ=EST:20240618_063838.jpg)

- under-wear (= 1 under shirt + 1 under pants) x 5
- small towel
- small umbrella
- charging brick (2 types) + cable
- wireless earphones
- wired earphones
- passport
- a mint tin containing nail clippers and ear swabs
- epinephrine injector (expired), albuterol inhaler (expired), antihistimine tablets (probably expired if they can expire)
- wallet, wallet, and organization pouch thing
- (not pictured) plastic "teeth retainer"
- (not pictured) my glasses, shorts, socks, crocs worn

this is slightly less stuff i brought compared to last trip i took. however it was good and not lacking. tbh if lacking something can just buy it in the country of travel anyways lol. one thing i slightly *maybe* wish i had was an eye sleeping mask. because i think would make sleeping on plane easier. i think it would be light and small enough to justify carrying. however also, i found that just putting a face mask over ur eyes works quite OK. i expect if the face mask is dark color it would work even better. so maybe i should try that one day.

# day 0: IAD -> YYZ

the first day was travel from USA to Canada. my flight was at 6:30am so i woke up at around 2am i think (i had been waking up earlier in these days to adjust schedule) and ate a cold tuna salad croissant i had bought the day before from company i work for.

hello. welcome to the food review sections of this travel documentation. here i will both quantify and qualify various aspects about the foods i ate during the trip.

this cold tuna-salad croissant did not taste particularly good and it was 2am. thus i give this food an overall low score.

then my dad drove me to airport at like 3am (thanks dad) and i arrived at airport and checked in and went through security. i remember the person checking me in asked me sth like how it was travelling without a carrier orso i believe. and i said it was good . less to carry around. i do believe indeed.

then i just walked randomly around IAD for two or three hours post-security. it was cold and i didnt rlly have anything to do.

just this short flight and soon arrived in toronto.


![toronto probably (idk)](20240619_074243.jpg)

btw idk why but i thought they always ask you to open plane windows during takeoff and landing but i dont remember anybody doing this any of my flights this trip i think? idk why. maybe i am forgetting some.

# YYZ

at the canada toronto airport i went through some kind of transfer area or sth i dont really remember and ended up back in the YYZ gates. i then had 5 hour layover. idrked what to do. i already am past security so i cant rlly leave the airport even if i wanted to probably (idk).

so i just walked around and sat around etc. randomly until flight.

# YYZ convenience store sandwich and potato chips

i bought turkey sandwich (CAD 11.99) and ketchup potato chips (CAD 3.79) from some kind of convenience store and ate it for my lunch. it was a self-checkout register. also i bought a box of maple something themed biscuits to give to friend that would probably have meal with in future.

the turkey sandwich was about what turkey sandwich taste like. the ketchup potato chips was new to me but simply tasted like.. ketchup potato crips.

![ketchup potato crips](20240619_102510.jpg)

for my drink i filled the plastic box my sandwich came in with water from the water-bottle refill station and drank that.

![here was a piece of art which was like large round walls or sth. there was many dust on them. here you can maybe see someone drew heart in the dust.](20240619_112148.jpg)

![there was birds in the airport](20240619_115147.jpg)

oh and also the sinks were pretty bad. low water pressure, volume, bad automatic activation, spout placement, etc. Like when i used the airplane sink it felt more convenient than yyz sink. and also they had this one staircase that i walked up and down a lot which actually stimulated legs quite a bit. cool!

then i was going to board my YYZ -> ICN flight. however they must have overbooked plane or sth and was making an announcement "looking for someone can go to japan and then korea instead of directly to korea. arrive like 3 hours later in total" or sth. in exchange for 300 dollars (but canadian).

i thought, ok sounds cool ig so i went up and did it. person used computer and then gave me boarding pass for flight to japan. and then i said "how do i get boarding pass to korea when im in japan" and they were like "oop true lol mb thx for mentioning that!" and then gave me not a boarding pass bc they say they cant check in korean-air flights? and they just gave me some kind of "e-ticket receipt/itinerary" and sent me on my way. so i went ahead and boarded the flight to japan which was literally the next gate over.

# YYZ -> KIX

this was a long and painful flight. young humans crying, yelling. slept not much.

# YYZ -> KIX meal 1

![food](20240619_142919.jpg)

- beef and rice i think
- corn and edamame
- uh noodles with i think sauce i forgot to apply
- cold, hard bread (with butter)
- (not pictured) creemore lager 1 can

the food was pretty OK except the bread, which was exceptionally cold and hard. like it was colder than the cabin temperature pretty sure. idk why. brownie-esque thing was pretty good except that it coated my teeth with brownie mush iirc.

i was confused why there was no napkin and i just used a bit of paper towel i took from some airport restroom. i now realize it was probably in the utensil pack thing and i just didnt see it. also, the (disposable) utensils (fork, spoon, knife) were made of bamboo i think which was neat.

besides ate the food and existing in a state of not really sleep but sort of sleep, i also looked at the in-flight entertainment. among other things i watched briefly, i watched:

- some japanese animation about girl that drinks a lot in kyoto or something
- about half of a french (canadian) film abt vietnamese immigrant family (named "ru" i believe)
- the whole korean movie "parasite" except i skipped over about like half of it because was uncomfortable/anxiety-causing

# KIX

eventually arrived at the kansai international airport. i expected to maybe be able to just transfer to my next flight. however, i see to transfer there is another security check where you need your boarding pass. and i do not have boarding pass, i only have some kind of receipt that air canada gave me.

i tried to check into my flight on both air canada and korean air websites or app etc. but i dont any success. so i kind of wandered confusedly in the transition zone between arrival gate and immigration. eventually i walked up to a worker that like directs ppl around and communicated approx my problem ("no boarding pass" or sth idk). and they talked to some other ppl in both korean and japanese and the conclusion was i think that i needed to go through immigration and go to check-in counter as if i were just coming from japan.

so some ppl guided me around, helped me fill out an arrival card (which was essentially like listing my flights and intended stay as like "3 hours" or sth), and sent me through immigration. and i think the immigration person was confused and asked me like "enter country"? or so and i said "no just transfer" and they were like 🤔 and either sent me back or called ppl over or sth? and then the ppl that had guided me over explained sth and they were like "oh ok" or sth, and then just gave me a 90-day tourist visa which.. like i could have probably just gotten without explaining to everyone my problems? i expected them to give me like a special "very temporary visa" or so bc im just in there for like 3 hours but.. oh well idk.

![kix](TZ=JST:20240620_164535.jpg)

i then went to the korean-air checkin and the check-in kiosk didnt work for some reason so i had to go to the counter and the person checked me in. and i went through airport security and found my way to my gate.

and i had a few tens of minutes or so so i looked around that area's shops (not too many because was like a smaller wing or sth i think). and then i stood in line for a convenience store where i picked out some food to eat for dinner

::: food
# KIX convenience food

![purchased](20240620_180357.jpg)

- rice ball ([辛子明太子](spicy cod roe?)) (JPY 189)
- rice ball ([紅しゃけ](red salmon?)) (JPY 180)
- sushi set (JPY 498)
- sokenbicha (JPY 159)

![sushi set in detail](20240620_180740.jpg)

i bought these foods at the convenience and ate it in some seats waiting at gate.

the rice balls just tasted like rice balls. the sushi set was very exceptional. idk why but it just tasted very good. and the little thing of wasabi they provided was labelled as real wasabi i believe?? (as opposed to horseradish paste with green food coloring?). which tbh i can believe bc it tasted quite good and they provided very little and in a squeezy packet thing so u use all of it. this sushi was tbh some of best food i had in life i believe and im not even really a big sushi enthusiast (based on sushi ive eaten in united states, it's just OK).

and soon it was time to go to korea!. tbh i had wondered im already in japan and im gonna be in japan again soon. maybe i should just not go to korea?. however, air canada gave me this free flight. and also i had said to friend EAT MEAL together. thus i go to korea.

# KIX -> ICN

the flight from to japan to korea was less than 2 hours i believe. here is some notes

- it was awkward when i had to get to window seat when korean [아재](ajay) was in aisle seat and my inability to say anything led me to simply kind of like stand there and sort of body language "i need to get in" except it probably just looked like i stood there and stared

	- some time else in the flight they also like leaned super over me in order to take a picture out the window and after they did this told me, "[쏘리](ssori)"

- the cabin smelled vaguely like smoke. idk if is this just bc it had absorbed smoke smells over long period of time or it was just this particular flight's clientele that smoked more than average or what. however it smelled more smokey than usual.

- they served an entire meal on the flight even thought it was literally less than 2 hours. idk why. expensive flight perhaps. it was unexpected.

# korean air food

![korean air food](20240620_193458.jpg)

- chicken with rice
- nuts
- fruits
- cup of water
	- very fun

iirc (may not correct) chicken was sorta teriyaki flavor? which is not my taste. chicken was the only choice btw they did not offer e.g. "beef or chicken" or anything.

did not eat nuts bc idk if allergy to some of them. fruits good. cup of water was very fun and cool.

# day 0 (korea)

i arrived south korea at like 8:30 pm probably around. iirc tried to ride train didnt have enough money on my transportation card. or maybe i did i dont really remember. but added 5000 won to my card with some cash i had left over from last trip. and tried to withdraw more cash from an ATM with my debit (atm) card but it didnt work. idrked why. so i just got on train and rode into seoul.

i rode to seoul station even though i didn't really need to go to seoul station because i thought maybe since it's named "seoul station" it would be tourist friendly and have good global ATM or sth where i could withdraw cash. unfortunately i only found one ATM and did not work for me. i still dont know if its just bc i didnt press the right buttons or i really just could not use that atm.

but anyways after i did that i got back on train and maneuvered myself to.. the same sauna i stayed at the last day of my last trip. however due to a lack of internet idrked if i was going the right way.

::: notes
# EXCERPT FROM MY NOTES THAT EXPLAINS SITUATION
22:46

idrk if im going the right way bc i cant see the map from where im standing and i can never get a glimpse of wifi to get the subway map on phone and idrk if the station im intending going is correct in the first place
:::

but eventually i got to where i needed

![south of gangnam station](TZ=Asia/Seoul:20240620_232920.jpg)

and i entered the sauna.

OK this part is kind of a flop but its also sort of funny. i entered the door and took off my shoes and stood in the passage. and the dude at the front desk said sth like "put them [anywhere](아무데나?)" which i did not interpret to mean "in any shoe box" so i literally put them like back at the entrance bc there was like some shoes there for some reason and they were like "no [idk what else]" so i realise ohh probably meant any shoe box! so that was awkward and i put my shoes in a box and locked and took the key to the front

and so that was weird and then i believe they were suspicious and they were like [우리나라사람blahblahidk](sth like, Are You Korean or so) and then i did something like communicate "no" and then they replied something like "then where u from" (but in korean) and i probably said at least half of the phrase "[the u.s.](미국)" and they said sth like "r u not [미성년자](a minor)?" and then i shook head and they asked for my ID (but in korean) and i showed them my passport and then they were like oh lol. [쏘리](ssori).

and they did payment for [KRW 15000](USD 10.88) and let me in. and i took shower no bath i was already pretty shook i did not need any risk no matter how small of drawing any kind of attention to self. oh but also i forgot/just didnt buy a toothbrush or toothpaste. so i just took a little blob of toothpaste from one of the communal toothpaste tubes and rubbed it around in my mouth and that was good enough. (i was thinking of maybe using a communal(?) toothbrush but i was too afraid of contracting something from that.) i also utilized the urinal that was installed in the shower room which imo is funny and cool, sort of.

![in bed](20240621_002018.jpg)

changed into sauna clothes go to sleep room. used phone a bit probably. the had usb-c chargers in all the little sleep booths but mine was broken i think so i just pulled over the wire from booth next to me since nobody was there.

eventually fell asleep some time. (probably)

# day 1 (korea)

even though i was very tired when i went to sleep, i woke up at 5 or 6. used bathroom. randomly saw that NewJeans was gonna be on some japanese news program at 6 or something. and so i downloaded some japanese-tv app and watched japanese morning tv in korean sauna.

and i did not ever fall back asleep iirc so i eventually got up, probably some time around 8am. took shower (and bath i think..?) and bought a KRW-1000 razor from sauna vending machine and shaved and left.

it was agreed to meet friend at 2pm and idked what to do before that. i believe i decided to go to [현대백화점](hyundai department store) in [apgoojong](압구정) because i was intending on buying a shirt some time. and also i had never been to 현대백화점 and curious. so i went there. there was what seemed like an entrance to directly to the department store with many ppl so i followed them in but sth sorta felt off. and then person that was supervising ppl entering said sth like "[직원이세요?](are you an employee?)" and then i replied something like "ajdsiofjaisf" and turned around and left (i think they also said sth abt entering from diff way or diff time but i honestly dont remember or didnt understand)

and so i walked westwards along apgoojong road. i saw a bank went in try to withdraw cash. failed again. exited and looked around. idked what to do.

walked a bit more. see convenience store. think stop for a little snack, breakfast. bc mealtime is far. honestly dont want to go in and purchase. but eventually just went in. honestly dont even remember what the dialogue was but i managed to pay for food items with card and leave.

::: food
# breakfast in apgoojong

![food](20240621_094319.jpg)

- rice ball STIR-FRIED RED CHILI PASTE & BEEF
- vitamin c drink
- corn beard tea

rice ball was meh. vitamin c drink taste like vitamin c drink. corn beard tea tasted like um.. corn beard tea. ate standing some random convenient spot to the side of the road in like 2 mins.

corn beard tea contained majority chinese-sourced corn products btw, i believe.

then i walked to HAN RIVER

![a surprisingly pleasant walk to the HAN RIVER](20240621_094914.jpg)

![han river](20240621_095439.jpg)

it was nice. i walked along. there were some exercises equipments in various spots. one spot had none people and i like played around on the bars. however bars were really slippery and idk what i was doing and also for some reason my hands felt really bloated. and also i was sleep deprived. and played around on the dips bar things. and i also tried the cute leg press thing which was fun.

![park on a thursday afternoon](20240621_101507.jpg)

walked more. saw some pigeons, and people

![perfect to go for a swim! also i saw fish near here. were quite big fish too i think.](20240621_104139.jpg)

found some park and benches. sat in a bench. cleaned my ear with earswab because it was itchy idk why. thought, "maybe i should go to fukuoka". looked up fukuoka ferry from busan. idked. got up walked more.

![me fr](20240621_115859.jpg)

came across playground. swung on the swing. walked more. there was some kind of construction or sth which i walked around bc i didnt want to risk interacting with the person who seemed to be telling ppl to go around or idk what they were doing. and ended up simply leaving han river area.

leave, walk to station. on the way exiting i witnessed pair of i believe japanese tourists like taking random pictures at some of the park exercise equipment which was funny and relatable

walk to train station. go back to gangnam station, except actually i think i got off a station above on accident or on purpose or i dont remember why.

but i walked south intending to go to my fav store [무인양품](muji) and buy a shirt n stuff. on the way, i passed many cafes and starbucks and stuff and remember thinking, "i am quite thirsty. and hot. and could use caffeine. and i am in korea. an iced americano sounds like it would make sense now". however none of them looked very approachable. starbucks app didnt work. at some point i entered a starbucks i think. and there was no kiosk or anything. and so i simply turned around and left.

i reached the [무인양품](muji) and went in and bought a white short-sleeved and black shorts and left. why these specific clothings? here is the reasoning i made up:

1. white shirt is universal, i.e. every type of person in every culture seems to be able to wore white shirt it has become normal, idk why.

2. i have always wanted to try wearing a short-sleeved shirt (not t-shirt). seems fun

3. one of newjeans latest concept featured same styling, and i am going to they concert so it is appropriate

4. it seemed like a fun challenge if i can go whole trip without spilling food on white shirt

after i purchased these clothes i walked further south towards designated meeting place. along the way i went into a daiso. i waited a while long time waiting for person that was refilling the drink refrigerator. and while i waited for that i went up a floor and waited a while long time for someone to finish looking at toothbrushes so i could look at them myself.

anyways i purchase a bottle of water (not refrigerated very much) and toothbrush+toothpaste set and go meet friend.

meet friend. walk. end up go to [kimbob heaven](김밥천국) which had seen often before and wanted to go but never went because afraid to go. funnily enough you just order at a kiosk. however imo it still does seem awkward if you go alone.

![nice](20240621_145057.jpg)

friend eat: tuna kimbob i think. but also they gave me several slices of it.

i eat: cheese [rabokki](라볶이) and [dongasoo](돈가스).

the kimbob and rabokki quite yummy. tbh i was not big fan of dongasoo. i did not really like the sauce. i think i had a sodium headache after this. not sure though.

![this was the ground i walked upon](20240621_170839.jpg)

also this person randomly gave us fans and this handout for some kind of investment, bank, something idrk what. that was interesting, but also reminded me of an experience i had earlier in the day which was someone looked like they were trying to give me wet wipes?. and they were saying something to me but i could not hear or understand so i just acted confused until they said "[외국사람](foreigner)?" and i nodded and they let me go. perhaps they were just trying to give me a promotional wet wipes and some flyer or sth.

walk around, and soon it was sort of dinner time. i had wanted to try either [piss fish](홍어), [cow intestines](곱창), or [raw meat](육회). my friend picked [you kway](raw meat).

we ordered set with raw fish (salmon i believe) and beef and [fist bob](주먹밥). and they also gave us (not pictured) a free [egg jim](계란찜).

it was simply order on kiosk tablet thing at table and bring food. the store was very.. sterile? clean ?. which was nice ig.

the food was um.. i mean it was def not bad. the beef was quite nice it is about what you would expected seasoned raw beef to taste like. the fish um.. it was nice i guess. idk if it was best raw fish ive had, but idk much about raw fish.

after eat, walk over to mcdonalds where friend enjoy icy hallabong drink or so, and i engage in indecision about what i should do tomorrow. perhaps visit seoul library. perhaps fly fukuoka japan. oh need to go record shop buy friend an record they requested. etc.

eventually time to depart i dont made any decision. say good bye. go back to.. the same sauna!! haha. this check-in was much smoother process and now i knew what "put anywhere" meant. and i think i body languaged myself through entire process, and maybe even said half of a "thank you" but in korean.

i took shower. bath idk. lied in bed spot. i thought: perhaps go to fukuoka tmrw. went to purchase ticket on phone app. however i needed my credit card to complete the purchase ?!. thus i did not complete the purchase. decide would do tmrw. it was 8pm approx, go to sleep.

# korea, and japan (day 2)

i woke up around midnight with something that felt like a sinus infection, which was unfortunate. i also realised i had forgotten to give friend the biscuits i bought at canada, so i messaged them so, and they replied say oops can meet in morning.

i did idk for next like 1 or 2 hours on phone. and fell back asleep sometime prob like 2am, and woke up around 7am probably. get up get ready leave sauna, go to an mcdonalds and eat a breakfast and use phone while wait for friend

it was quite delicious nice. "shanghai chicken snackwrap" is sort of like a chicken tender wrapped in tortilla with other fillings. i believe. the actual real ceramic cup that the cappuccino came in was a nice touch.

during this breakfast time i looked at flights and stuff and i saw a cheap flight from ICN -> KIX for only USD 61.61, and so i simply bought it. and then i wondered what i would do once i got there. and so i booked hotel for the night in nara, japan. once i saw something about nara has deer. so i decide would be cool to go, etc.

eventually meet friend, give them biscuits. say goodbye. then, I go to [hongday](홍대) in order to buy an LP that an friend had requested.

![begin to rain](20240622_101851.jpg)

unfortunately i got to the record shop and it opened at 2pm. however my flight was at 4:05 pm. and train to airport from seoul takes bare minimum estimate like 1 hour. would it be possible to run to train, run from train, check in, get through security, find gate all in 1 hour??. tbh i was not too sure.

so i just walked around the area for a while because it was soon time for lunch. walk around look at random shops n stuff. it was rainy. there was many tourists i believe

![rainy](20240622_115142.jpg)

i end up go to a restaurant i passed once looked good, walk around, come back because nothing looked better. and it looked to have kiosk.

the order process was: go in, sit down self, order on kiosk, someone brings out side dish and water. wait. someone brings out food.

i think i got [소고기국밥 정식](beef googbab set) = beef soup + beef [meat jone](육전)?. and also extra rice. it was quite good, especially on rainy day and what feel like sinus infection beginning of illness. i like this type of flavor profile food in general. also i was also wearing new white shirt and it felt like enthralling challenge to not get anything onto it.

half of energy spent do not get food onto shirt, and other half of energy spent to figure out how to get LP. luckily did not get food onto shirt. and also concluded that this record store in hongday probably only option to get LP today.

after eat, got up left (there was no self dish return based on observations). returned to record store. it was indeed still closed. and also the same guy i saw waiting(?) outside was still waiting(?) outside it. i was decided cannot risk flight, and also tbh it would kind of be really inconvenient to carry around LP for rest of trip. thus just leave for airport.

# aside: vitaminmaxxing
i have found that korea and japan have these various vitamin drinks that are usually carbonated and sweet and come in small glass bottle and contains artificially high amount of vitamins in them.

you can see i ate one yesterday breakfast with my rice ball and corn beard tea. however i also ate one while waiting for train sometime now (picture not provided). and also several in japan, as if they could perhaps help to solve my illness and sleep deprivation.

![a rainy day crossing the han river. i got up from my seat to take this video and when i did someone took my seat. oops!. though makes sense maybe i was gonna get off next stop or sth.](20240622_131005.mp4)

i got off at terminal 1 and walked into terminal 1. however there i discovered the airline i was taking was actually terminal 2 which was awkward so i hurried back to train to take it 1 more stop to terminal 2 which required me to reload transportation card and also gave me a slight scare because i thought i accidentally got on a train going the opposite direction. however it was in the correct direction.

![icn](20240622_142640.jpg)

i checked in flight in which the person checking me in asked me if i spoke korean, in korean. and i went through security. south korea uses those giant xray scanner machines like the u.s. does and i asked for instead pat-down and someone gave me a very lenient pat-down and let me through.

![기분이 좋아요, 여행은 진에어](20240622_153551.jpg)

the plane was very wide, there were like 3 + 4 + 3 seats where i was sitting. the flight ended up getting delayed 35 mins, and it also taxiied for 20 mins before actually taking off.

there was no meal or snack, i believe. there was, however, a brief time of sunlight, i suppose above the clouds, rain. it was sunny. however, soon smoothly land at KIX, with clouds and rain.

get off plane go to immigration. they had i think heat cameras? to check ppls body temperatures?. tell people to take their hats off. and i was slightly nervous because tbh it had started to feel like i was getting a fever. however nothing happened i just kept walking.

went through immigration. i thought they would just like.. reuse? recognise? my 90-day tourist visa from 2 days ago, but they just gave me another 90-day tourist visa sticker.

there was an ATM between immigration and customs so i tried withdraw japan cash. i failed, but i tried again and realised i had been pressing "credit" instead of "checking" account. and when i clicked "checking" it worked very well. fantastic!.

withdrew cash and went through customs. i actually could not find any more english customs forms except in the form of poorly photocopied one-sided printer paper. so i filled one of those out.

going through customs actually feels felt like one of most normal human interactions i managed to ever have in japanese:

- person: [passport plz](パスポートでお願いします)

- me: fumbles around for passport and takes out

- me: flip through the passport for the id page because idk people usually need the id page i think

- person: [its fine (you dont need to open it to whatever)](そのままでいい(ん?)です)

- me: just hand it to person and they do sth with it and give it back and i am good to go or sth

then i am in KIX once again. and i saw a SIM card vending machine. what they have SIM card vending machine?? thats cool. so i bought 3gb 15 days for JPY 1800 i believe.

and then i used bathroom or sth and also saw they have restaurants. and i think it would make sense to eat food now because it was  around um.. 7, 8 time for dinner. and also since airport is high concentration of tourists, it is socially acceptable and normal for not know wth you are doing maybe.

so i went over a "Sukiya" which i had seen many times before wanted to try. it was order on a kiosk and the kiosk print out your ticket and you give ticket to person and they help you with your payment. they asked me if i had point card which i successfully understood but then they asked me something like what type of payment i was gonna use which i did not understood and i looked confused and they tell me in english etc.

::: food
# My first Sukiya

![food](20240622_195511.jpg)

eat big eel rice and pickle and orange juice. just eel rice big was JPY1980 which is pretty expensive for a food imo. however eel is expensive i think understandable. i personally do not like teriyaki taste profile. thus honestly i didnt really like this meal.

also the orange juice had four cubes of very rectangular ice i felt like i was drinking highball with the quality of ice they gave.

after meal go to take the train. i was staring at the JR map or sth wondering should can i take JR? i kinda wanna try different train companies bc i took almost exclusively JR last trip. and then some tourists walked up to me say can you help us buy train tickets to kyoto

and so i help them which is you just look at map and see the number and buy a ticket with that value. how fun!. but actually idrk if i helped them properly because i didnt even like give them directions how u get there with the ticket. or what line to take. and im guessing KIX to kyoto is such a common path they might have a special train just for that route so. idk if i actually helped helpfully, but hopefully they got there alright.

anyway i end up taking some non-JR train. the train was very.. charming? ig?. i think tokyo has a sort of sterile charm where everything is very clean and sparkly, and osaka's charm is um.. non-sterile? and people are more likely to cross at red pedestrian lights, drive loud cars, etc. that kind of vibe.

anyway i was riding the train and i was kinda thirsty, craving an pocari sweat. thus began my game of "can i get off train, buy pocari sweat from vending machine, and make it back on train?". so i wait a few stops before train pull up to a vending machine that i see has pocari in it. rush over, buy it. but i wonder why change not dispensing. and this is when i realised figured out you need to press the change handle thing if theres enough money left over to buy another drink or so. but i pressed it and fumbled to get change, train pull out. how unfortunate.

luckily next relevant train was in only like 15 mins or so. so sat in train station which was pretty empty, except for the sound systems which kept playing a bunch of overlapping announcements about idk what.

![station. hands shaking.](20240622_210436.mp4)

eventually train come. arrive at transfer station. i didnt really know what train taking and just stepped on a train that said it go to Nara, and it ended up being the right choice i think. arrive at Nara.

![welcome to nara](20240622_221126.jpg)

![small shibuya in nara](20240622_221407.jpg)

nice hotel. it was same brand hotel as i stayed in last day in japan last trip. and same as i will stay many times this trip. same check-in process (give them ur passport / they scan passport and make u fill out sth like ur name, home address, phone / thats it). took bath and drank water. the end.

# day 3 (japan)

this day i woke up middle of night, went back to sleep, etc. not feeling too great etc., eventually morning fully come i exit hotel. this hotel brand checkout is you just put ur key in a box and walk out. that is what i did.

i walked over to some train station area that has a convenience store and shopping street and stuff. i went into the convenience store and purchased wet wipes, masks, a sandwich, and a vitamin drink. i see it has a self-register which is first time i think i ever saw, noticed japan has one of those i think??. so i tried to use it.

for some reason i dont remember it having english idk if i just forgot to press the english button??. and the barcode scanner u have to basically touch it to the product which i did not expect. and i think it said something like "pls press the 'i dont need bag' button if u dont need bag" or something, i dont really remember and idk japanese.

finally i scanned everything try to payment. the options were something like mobile qr payment, mobile tap payment?maybe?, credit card (swipe?) payment?, or something. first i thought maybe tap credit card would be similar to mobile tap? idrked. didnt work. try credit card swipe? did not work. how troublesome!. i was taking quite a while.

worker eventually came out and looked and probably tapped an option that i didnt know what it meant and then i could tap credit card and it worked. idrk what happened but i was free and so i was happy.

i sat down on some sort of bench that looked like a stone, or stone that look like bench. unfortunately there was a lot of water pooled on it and thus my pants became very wet. there, i ate my sandwich and vitamin drink.

then i strolled over to nara park which had lots of tourists and deer which was cool and cute

![nara](20240623_100251.jpg)

![i carried around my trash for entire day in nara park, which included at least small glass vitamin drink bottle, sandwich wrapper, and later another small glass vitamin drink bottle. luckily it will not be the case that a deer will eat my trash and die](20240623_101454.jpg)

![deer](20240623_104328.jpg)

i kept walking around and stuff and eventually came across a large hill. if you imagine "hill" that is what it looked like. simply large grassy hill thing.

![hill with toll booth](20240623_104958.jpg)

you had to pay to get in and touch the hill, so i did not really plan on going in. however i saw some tourists around and one paid and went in so i simply also went up and said sth like "one (please)" and gave my money (JPY 150) and they gave me a ticket and showed me a warning like "it is rainy so dont slip and die" and let me in

there was many stairs so in the rainy drizzle weather and in my now-feverish state i climbed the many stairs up the hill.

![last set of stairs](20240623_110156.jpg)

![hill](20240623_110333.jpg)

there were many stairs and at the top (not really top) of hill it was very viewous. view very cool and nice.

![the niceness of view is not fully captured in photos i took, but it was nice](20240623_110943.jpg)

it was also nice and quiet. only one other person up there at the time. and a pair of crows.

![crow kept make a crow noise](20240623_111204.mp4)

after sitting a while on a bench on the hill, went further up the hill following behind the other person and also the pair of crows.

![the crows were literally hopping up the hill in front of me. though i think eventually they flew away some time.](20240623_111512.jpg)

eventually i see i can go even further. however my body state did not feel too great and looking at google maps i dont think there was any public transport that can get me out if i walk further in. thus i turned back and walked back down the hill.

![a deer on the hill](20240623_112248.jpg)

![i assume these drums of water randomly see in japanese mountains are for in case of forest fires? idrk though.](20240623_112817.jpg)

![down the mountain, a different way](20240623_113314.jpg)

![i saw this small deer](20240623_114024.jpg)

i exit the hill area and stroll around the touristy souvenir shop etc. area. i was tired not intending to walk back to where i came from. so intend take bus. so go towards bus stop, and as i go towards, see bus coming. omg!

i jog along sort of but tbh idek if it is right bus and such, and idk actually how to ride a bus. so i just sort of jog but as if i am not really intending to ride bus. and i see bus pull into stop. and tbh i probably could have ran up to it and ridden it, but i was not mentally prepared for it. so i simply stopped and let it go. i checked the schedule and next one came in umm.. idk, but in some time. So in the meanwhile i strolled back around the touristy souvenir shop area.

most shops except for one seemed dead at this time, unfortunately. it seemed like nara must be known for cutting instruments bc there was shops with um like knives and scissors and swords(?) i believe. eventually i had seen enough and went back to bus stop.

bus i had never ridden in japan. it will be my first experience!. according to internet i looked up, did not seem too difficult. however also i saw this bus seemed to be a flat-rate 100 yen bus for tourism purposes, so i expected it would be somewhat different.

eventually bus pulled up. entrance was unexpectedly through the front (it was labelled i believe). i got on; driver say something i dont remember but also say sth like [お先にどうぞ](put ur money in first) so i took my 100 yen coin i prepared ahead of time and couldnt find the coin box and they gestured to it and i put it in and took a seat and they took off.

i was literally only person in bus, i believe. and i rode it to furthest stop closest to city and got off, which ended my first bus ride in japan.

the stop i got off was some sort of temple i think. there were many tourists. you had to pay to get in and i didnt wanna do that so i left the area and walked back to the area with train station, convenience store, shopping street.

::: aside
# that temple
lately i was browsing internet or so and i found out that temple was sort of a big deal, like at least sort of more big of a deal than the dango i remember was sold nearby and i sort of wanted to try but ended up dont. a world heritage site or something? and the like gate i actually passed through national treasure? and etc. oops!. maybe i should look these things up beforehand.
:::

i strolled through shopping street. and i happened to see a vietnamese restaurant which looked pretty good and they also had an english menu and the area was filled with tourists which made me expect that they expected nonjapanese tourists. so, i went in it was up some stairs.

go in open the door. i think they probably asked me how many people i was, though i forgot they ask that and idk japanese so i sort of acted confused or maybe they asked me in english but anyways the fact was probably eventually established that i was one person. however they was full so they say something like "10 (idk) mins" and gave me a menu and i stood at the entrance existing.

eventually table open up someone say to go to seat i went to seat. someone came out brang utensils and cup of water and i ordered likely by sort of point and hold up 1 finger and iirc they replied sth like "[はい、(thing i ordered probably) いち](OK, one [thing i ordered])", which sort of confused me because i did not know that was a valid construction in japanese. tbh maybe it wasnt and they were just using alternate japanese to deal with foreign customer, or idk. or maybe i didnt hear correctly, didnt understand context, etc. however the message was communicated. eventually, food was broughten out.

::: food
# vietnamese food in japan

![food](20240623_130353.jpg)

i ordered got the "pho bo lunch" which was beef noodle soup, pork over rice, a little serving of salad, and a shrimp puffed cracker thing. cost was JPY 1100.

was pretty good, though honestly i still dont know why the shrimp puffed cracker thing was there perhaps some cultural reasons but felt kinda random to me. some differences from vietnamese noodle soup i had in united states is:

- provide a lemon instead of lime
- put the bean sprouts in for you instead of letting u do urself

was good!. finished all the soup as well i think; the portioning and setup made it sensible to do so i believe.

also the restaurant was cozy restaurant vibes pretty cool and nice.

after eat, pay at counter, leave. next i walked around not rlly know what to do. i kind of wanted to buy a shirt(s) that is knock-off brands but nara-themed. for example i saw sold in convenience a patagonia knockoff shirt that was "[naranoshika](nara deer)" with deer instead of mountains in the logo which was so funny and cute at same time. and also elsewhere saw like adidas knockoff and stuff and it was funny and sort of i wanted to buy. but at same time i questioned whether would actually wear it, would have to carry around rest of trip, etc. so i end up do not buy.

anyways i went into train station and boarded a train labelled as towards kyoto. i was confused because i could not actually figure out what train line and train it was and i dont think google maps listed the train i was on? so i was confused but i rode it and it did go towards kyoto in a desirable manner so i continued to ride it.

arrive at kyoto station and went to the shinkansens. i didnt know how buying tickets worked so at first i think i just bought a "fare ticket" or sth? and tried to go through gates but said sth like "insert ????" and i was confused and went back to machine and i concluded, oh maybe you need to buy a seat in addition to the fare ticket?. so i bought an unreserved seat and u put both into the ticket gate (you can put in both in at once which is crazy) and it let me through. and then i looked for train, but i was going to "hamamatsu" which is not a major stop so i had to wait quite a while.

::: aside
# aside: shinkansen

kyoto station had i believe at least two platforms of trains headed towards tokyo at like 8-9 minute intervals, which is one high-speed train leaving for tokyo every 4-5 mins which is kinda a crazy frequency for any type of train. the fact you can just go up to a machine buy ticket and board high-speed train that goes across entire country in just a few mins is kind of crazy imo.

:::

while i waited i walked around just the little area inside shinkansen gates and it was quite busy lots of ppl. souvenir shops, food shops, lots for u to consume. bathroom, waiting room, vending machine, etc. at some point a couple with strollers entered and their dog who was quite a yapper was yapping and everyone was kinda like ?? and like some station ppl came over and was escorting them and i thought maybe it was against rules take pets on train so was they escorting them out? but nope they were just leading them to the elevators so can elevate strollers up to platform.

eventually train that will stop at hamamatsu came and i got on and rode the train. oh yeah i did not explain what hamamatsu is. it is city that maybe actually i stopped by before on last japan trip. but required bus riding, and i didnt want to figure out how to ride bus. so i skipped it then. but now i can go and try take bus, i thought. so in this morning i booked hotel in hamamatsu. cool!.

rode train nothing of note. price was JPY4510 for "fare ticket(?)" and JPY3400 for a free-seating seating ticket(?). got off hamamatsu.

i noticed very soon that hamamatsu had sea air you can feel taste it in air ocean. yum

![this is a picture of hamamatsu](20240623_172211.jpg)

i walked down the street and went to a matsuya and ate dinner

::: food
# hamamatu matsuya dinner

![the food](20240623_173248.jpg)

i ordered sth like "salt(?) pork tororo samgyetang meal"? (JPY 1100). i didnt really know what i ordered tbh it just sounded good. the sauce on pork was indeed salty, idk what flavor it really was. ive never had samgyetang so i wasnt actually sure if the soup provided was the samgyetang or did they mean the pork sauce was samgyetang-themed? i didnt know tbh the soup just tasted sorta like.. tonjiru? idk if there was even chicken in it? i dont remember.

also the white paste was slimy and sticky and idrked what it was (it is tororo i believe). dont think i even knew i ordered it. but now that i had it i tried eating it in various ways (dipping meat inside, mix with rice, by itself, etc.) and it was ok ig.

oh also i ordered potato salad (JPY 90) which is the small blob you can see on the salad. it was good i like potato salad.

# aside: is it normal to not say anything?
i have found that at matsuya and other mostly-self-service restaurants it seems sort of normal or possible to simply not say anything the only interaction(s) you really have is receiving something and you can just decline your head or sth to sort of communicate "thanks bro".

i dont really know if it is completely polite to do so but i am pretty sure i have seen entire meal sessions gone by the customer doesnt really say anything. on the reverse side i do have seen many people say some words when receiving, when leaving. (though def not too many words). however i have not yet completely understood the details of these social scripts so i am not sure. but i know they exist.

finish meal exit. walk to hotel.

arrive hotel, which is same brand as yesterday hotel. same procedure. same stuff, though slightly less clean. and there was an alcohol vending machine so i bought drank highball even though i felt like fever cold, was coughing. oh well!. bath shower and lie in bed with tv on and using phone, and eventually go to sleep.

![highball](20240623_183000.jpg)

iirc it didnt taste like much besides carbonated water. however it was ok i think. probably should have not eaten it when already suffering health. however overall i did not drink much alcohol this trip. for example in korea i thought about: i should buy alcohol and ice cream and eat it while looking at han river, that would be nice!. however i restrained myself from dranking the cancer water and i didnt. however this time there was simply an vending machine with alcohol and it was too easy access so simply i ate it.

![here was view of the bus stop bench. many car drive quite close to curb. across street you can see matsuya i just ate](20240624_072035.mp4)

i prepared the fare i would need to ride bus = 270JPY, according to google maps. however, when the bus arrive i forgot to take a ticket. oh no!!. i realised it late after i sat down i got back up go to the ticket box thingy to see if there was ticket but there was like not a ticket i could take? so i just sat back down. i also think the bus made a very noisy sound when i got on without taking a ticket but idk if that was unrelated.

::: aside
# aside: riding japan bus with cash

it is pretty cool that you can ride a japan bus with only cash, and quite easily. wow. here are the steps i found from the internet and have sort of verified works for the few time i took bus in japan:

1. enter through back door. there should be a box extruding a ticket you should be able to pull out. pull a ticket out.

2. on front screen of bus you can watch your bus fare go up corresponding to your ticket number.

3. when get off, there is a fare box at front. first put in ur ticket. then drop in your money coins. and should work, hopefully.

:::

yes so anyways i forgot to pull a ticket and so i sat on the bus thinking: oh no i forgot ticket. however i simply continued to ride. i thought about how it would resolve. how would i say i forgot ticket? would i show them the stop i got on? and they calculate it from there? or like uh.. idk? etc.

eventually my bus stop coming i press button. bus stop at the stop. i go to front with a few extra coins prepared in case, and i sayed "uhh forgotto chigetto" and then they sayed sth like "[ekikara [idk what else said]](sth like, You got on at the station right?)" and then manually entered the fare im guessing from the train station to where i got off (i actually got on slightly after station so the fare was approx +JPY50 but i wasnt about to argue that even if i had the ability to) and then i dropped in the necessary coins and got off.

so it worked out smoother than expected, and i went and walked across street or whatever to where i rode bus to: the Nakatajima Sand Dunes. it was is essentially lots of sand, and a beach.

![walk up this sand](20240624_075904.jpg)

![it is the beach](20240624_080021.jpg)

i love myself a beach. this beach was very nice. many waves. relatively not much human development except sometimes some piles of those um idk spiky ball things placed here and there. i walked westward along beach. shore had some places more rocky, some places more sandy.

![a more rocky spot with a pile of spiky things in the ocean](20240624_082547.jpg)

it was definitely one of best beach experiences i have had in life. only spot a few other humans along the beach. walk westward, and eventually end up where look either way you can only see beach in either direction, and to the back the view of city is blocked by sand dune/nature.

some where i saw some ppl had stacked some rocks. so i tried a bit stacking some rocks. however fell over. continue walking. in general very windy that day. afraid flying sand will sand down my glasses so walk nearer the shore. where instead ocean mist coat my glasses very much.

![water](20240624_101630.jpg)

walking westward a long time along the shore i think my hip kind of started hurting because the slant of the shore uneven walking. and also later became sunburn especially on back of neck and leg. according to photo timestamps estimate walked approx 8am to 11am. there was much more beach to walk, but stopped because probably lunchtime, and there was probably nearby bus stop can walk to.

![some path i walked while exiting beach](20240624_110512.jpg)

i walked trying to find bus stop that google labelled on map. however it seemed to be nonexistant. however a different bus stop also existed which actually seemed to be the correct one, even though google maps made it seem it was not the correct one.

![road](20240624_111009.jpg)

so i waited at that bus stop, which was in front of some sort of swimming centre. i walked in and saw there was a person at a front desk thus immediately walked back out. and waited at bus stop.

bus arrive and i get on, i remember take a ticket this time!!.

![summer bus waiting ambiance](20240624_113136.mp4)

bus drive over to hamamatu station, get off. one thing i have noticed two times riding bus in japan is that nobody presses the "stop bus" button when it is the last stop. ig since you have to get off?. also for some reason open the bus windows whilst the aircon is on? interesting.

at hamamatu station i found mcdonalds and ordered some mcdonalds to-go, and then i bought shinkansen ticket from the machine. except for some reason the tickets dont let me go through gate. and i was confused and bewildered. and coped with reality for a while until finally just go up to the counter thing and showed them my ticket(s) and acted confused. What i made out from what they told me (in mostly japanese i think) is that i bought a ticket with both fare AND a seat. but also a ticket with JUST fare (or seat?), which i didnt need?. so they actually refunded me the one i didnt need. and told me to just use the ticket that had both fare AND seat to go through. and it worked. tbh i am still confused how i even bought that combined fare+seat ticket (JPY7910) on accident i didnt even know that was possible.

train came and i rode it, and ate my mcdonalds

fries were as expected. vegetable drink tasted like.. um.. vegetable drink?. spicy nuggets tasted like chicken nuggets w/ slightly more flavor added. garlic butter teriyaki chicken tasted about as you may expect. even though i dont really like teriyaki flavors it was pretty good i think. edamame corn was generic it could be from random cafeteria in united states would make sense. "shaka shaka chicken", i am guessing think ur supposed to take the included powder and put in bag and shake around to coat the chicken?. however i was on train and also wear white shirt so i was slightly afraid. so i did not use much of the powder. just sprinkled a little on some of it.

soon arrived in tokyo (about 2 hrs?) and got off and was confused for a while because i thought an exit gate was an entrance gate. eventually exited at tokyo station.

![tokyo station](20240624_150313.jpg)

and i went to go ride some non-JR train but then i got lost cannot find it, so i just took JR. and then i got on the wrong train i think, but it was going along same path i think so i just got off next stop and the train i needed was right across the platform and also making a stop so that was convenient.

I rode over to shibuya where they was having a newjeans free cup event. simply stroll over, stand in a line, show them some stuff on ur phone, and get a free cup and can take pictures or write a thingy on a thing. very fun!.

![i did it](20240624_161129.jpg)

then i walked over to the shibuya tower records, but decided i was not hydrated and so first went over to a convenience store where i bought pocari sweat that was labelled as JPY150 but was actually JPY162 after tax. that convenience store also had a self register which was convenient. also pocari usually goes for like JPY170 in vending machines approx everywhere so its kind of crazy its only an JPY8 difference.

At tower records i looked around and bought a newjeans album which is essentially just a bag; a very nice and high-quality bag which i planned to use later as a secondary bag so i didnt have to carry around my entire trip bag with me at all times.

i exited tower records and sort of just wandered around shibuya station area in search of dinner. i remember passing by one like dumpling and noodles place? that looked pretty good and lots of tourists so felt safe, but i decided keep looking, and then probably didnt even know where it was so couldnt go back even if i wanted to.

eventually i just went on phone and googled something like "food" and scrolled through. one place looked pretty good, so i walked on over there. tbh it was a quieter area which sort of scared me, but there was a kiosk so i simply ordered on the kiosk. but unfortunately it was a kiosk where u still have to hand the ticket to a staff.

so i walked in with my ticket and staff said sth i didnt understand and i smiled and nodded (probably not really but equivalent action). and then realised i didnt understand so then i looked confused and then they likely said something in english like "counter or table?". retrospectively i think they said sth with the words "counter" and "[seki](seat)" so that makes sense. and then i gestured to some seat and sat down at the seat and they said ok and ask if speak english and i said yes and they told me in english that the water machine was over there and i said thx and they left and i got water and sat and waited for my food.

and food eventually came out and i ate it and left. the end

# aside: the spectrum of kiosks in japan restaurants

i have observed that there is a spectrum of how self-serve a restaurant is in japanese.

often there is a kiosk, and you can simply order on the kiosk, and the order sent directly to restaurant and you simply wait for your number to be called and then u go to counter pick up ur food urself.

However often you must hand the ticket that comes out of kiosk to a person, who may or may not guide you to your seat. and may perhaps know ur location and bring ur food out to your location. and there may or may not be a dish return. in summary, all of it exist on spectrum and thus idrk, idked what to expect at each new location.
:::

after finish meal, walk over back to shibuya station and took some trains. this time not JR but tokyo metro, i believe. tbh its about the same except the map looks different.

arrive at hotel. there were many foreigners at the hotel i believe. there was also a fancy checkin machine that scanned your passport or sth. except that it didnt work for me so someone came over checked me in manually. and they also gave me a free can of alcohol as like a free sample.

in my hotel room i realised my umbrella i had not aired out in a while (since nara?) and it was still moist and smelled not too great so i washed it in the shower. and i washed myself as well, and discovered that there was no coin laundry in specifically this hotel which was unfortunate because i was now wearing last clean clothes and that meant i would have to go out in the wild tmrw and do laundry there.

so i just sat in hotel room and consumed free alcohol, arranged bag n stuff with tv in background and happened to see newjeans on the tv. eventually sleep, probably.

# free alcohol

![can](20240624_201823.jpg)

i was not planning on drinking alcohol but since they gave it to me for free i drank it. i think it tasted like grain-flavored lacroix if that existed. i.e. sparkling water but grain flavors maybe? or maybe just sparkling water. tbh it was pretty good. and i think it had on the label sth like "zero sweeteners, blah blah blah" etc. so it made you feel like you are drinking something exquisitely natural and healthy and artisan or something. also it was free.

# day 5 (japan)

rise and shine, its the morning in tokyo! this morning i awoke with plans to do the following:

- do laundry
- buy binoculars
- pick up concert tickets

thus first thing to do was decide where to do my laundry. this was a challenge because idked where to do it. there are too many places to choose from. do i go to a different neighborhood ive never visited do it there? idk tokyo. what to do?

after many thinkings during yesterday and today, i decided to just do it near the hotel. in other words, just exit hotel and walk over to closeby coin laundry. because i do not even know nearby hotel so sounds good.

::: aside
# aside: where is tokyo?

do you know the composition of tokyo? I do not. i do not go around it enough to form any mental model of it. So far my mental model of tokyo is as follows:

1. Shinjuku (in the west)

2. Not Shinjuku (in the east) (near tokyo station)

this morning i exited my hotel which was "not shinjuku". I hope you found this information helpful.

:::

there was actually two coin laundry pretty close by and close together (like separated by a very small street). One of them i intended to go had english signage and looked like helvetica (the font) and hip like it was from some design school from germany. however i saw there was someone inside so i turned around and went to the one that was not the german-design-school coin laundry (and had no people). instead it was just japanese and literally only had japanese signage.

i do not know japanese btw so for a long while i stood around reading the signs not 100% sure what to do. however with the help of my brain and also google translate photo thing i convinced myself i was ready to try it out. and i tried it out, and seemed to work:

1. insert coins (JPY 300)
2. within 10 or 30 secs close the lid and press the "shower" button to clean the drum?.
	- the lid will lock and shower/clean?
3. and then the lid unlocks.. and then immediatelly starts filling with water?? this confused me.
4. but i just put my clothes in as the drum was filling with water and assumed i was doing the right thing.
5. it said it dont need laundry detergent itll put it in itself. so i trusted i did not need laundry detergent.
6. closed lid and left.

the cycle was about 40 mins i believe. and so i left and strolled on over to the local matsuya which was like 1 block away, where i ate breakfast.

::: food
# breakfast i ate at matuya as my laundry was washing

![food](20240625_084057.jpg)

after i finished breakfast i walked back over to laundry where i still had about 5 mins left in the laundry so i sat there on a stool waiting. someone walked in and did stuff and also my laundry finished and i put stuff into dryer, except my shirt which i believe could should not be drier-dried. i set drier for like um 16 mins. or actually probably decided add extra 8 mins so 24 mins. and then put on my moist non-dried shirt and exited the laundry and walked around the area.

tbh there was not much i saw. i think i just walked around a street or two and walked back. and bought a bottle of tea from a vending machine on way back.

drying finished. took out laundry. was gonna wipe down the folding table with one of my wet wipes but i couldnt find the wet wipes in my backpack so i was convinced that i accidentlly left them at matsuya when i took them out to wipe down table. however while i was mid-folding i found them in my backpack. oops!.

i packed all my laundry and next on to-do list was to buy binocular. why binocular? newjeans concert at tokyo dome large venue, lowest-tier seats, so expect binocular would potentially be good option in order to enhance sight. when i looked up "[binoculars recommendations](双眼鏡おすすめ)" in japanese the first or one of the pages was yodobashi camera which was imprinted onto my brain from seeing a random 80s commercial on youtube so i was gonna go to shinjuku yodobashi but i looked it up and apparently akihabara yodobashi is bigger so decided to go there instead.

akihabara yodobashi was only like 16 mins walking google maps said, from the coin laundry i was at. so i simply walked. and not too long into walk i could literally see the giant yodobashi camera sign from the street

and so i entered the yodobashi camera and found the binoculars section and looked the the binoculars and stuff. and when i was looking through many of the binoculars some staff was come over and showed me one pair and said something like "these see well", except in japanese, and then i was like ohh..! thanks except i didnt actually say that i just maybe conveyed something like that with maybe an "ah!"-like sound and body language, and then they sort of wandered away but were still present and so i decided it was time to pick one and get going. the ones they said see well did see quite well, and i noticed they were labelled as sth like "high sight point" or sth or idk but basically they work well with glasses on maybe? or something like that. so i looked through the binoculars labelled with that. some were labelled specifically as "recommended for tokyo dome" which was nice thanks.

Eventually picked one, with my indecision resolved by the presence of staff. so i took the little "bring this slip to register to purchase" and then headed away and then wondered wait is this the direction to the register and then the staff was like "oh register is that way" and i was like "oh ok thanks lol" and then i went to the register where i probably didnt understand something and person asked if i wanted tax-free which i have seen in many places but i still didnt dont really know what that is and sounds like trouble, so i said no thanks, but then the cashier was like umm i recommend. discount. so i said umm ok and handed over passport and they did idk what but anyways i probably got a discount. they also included a little handout with sth like tax-free procedure which looked complicated and confusing and i dreaded the thought of probably having to go through more stuff during exiting country. however whatever (more details later).

And so i had binoculars, two out of three things to-do done. i remember i sat on a bench, and then i got off the bench and went to tokyo dome (via train), as sort of scout-out-the area. prepare for concert which is the next day. and so i went there and ppl were setting up stuff n stuff and it was neat ig. And then i saw a taco bell which was a rare find i have literally not seen a taco bell in east asia ever. except for once in INCHEON INTL AIRPORT and once exactly here.

so i observed the menu for a bit and the humans that went inside and stuff, and decided, I will go in. and so i went in, and even though there was no kiosk as I had observed predicted, i did not turn around. simply i went up to the counter and said "big bell box one please" or the like, and they responded with questions like "what drink" and "for here or to go" etc, in english, and i responded to them. and thus i successfully ordered.

and i waited for the food. one interesting bit is that the worker that was i think preparing the food and calling the orders was , not japanese. and if my perception was correct i think they were sort of not confident about how exactly ur supposed to call the numbers. or maybe i am just perceiving this because i have no idea how the numbers are supposed to be called.

::: aside
# aside: how do you call numbers?

reading numbers is weird. for example, say you are calling a customer with number 115. do you say "one one five", or "hundred fifteen" or "one fifteen" or "eleven five" or something else?. what about "1015"? "ten fiveteen"? "thousand fiveteen"? "one zero one five"? etc.

these concerns are enhanced when thinking about in foreign language such as japanese and whenever i listen to called numbers i do not exactly know what to expect.
:::

but i do think that sometimes they called the number, and then called the number, but in a different way, or something. im not really sure idk japanese. but eventually they called my number which i think was like [百十五](ひゃくじゅうご) and i received the food

# TACO BELL JAPAN

![taco bell](20240625_113705.jpg)

this was "big bell box" which was a set (there was only like one possible set iirc, actually? not sure) containing:

- cola with bendy straw
- burrito
- taco
- chips
- "cinnamon twist"
- 2 mild sauce

and include a wet wipe.

i will not rate the sauce because honestly i dont really remember cannot qualify. (coca) cola tasted as expected. the ice was quite rectangular and nice. bendy straw bent.

"cinnamon twist" was my worst. its like umm. some sort of.. fried? popped puffed? thing with cinnamon sugar type flavor. however it tasted sort of stale. and i dont like sweet things.

"chips" was my next worst. it tasted sort of.. stale? as well. the seasoning was not even. simply tasted like unevenly seasoned tortilla chips. seasoning taste not of note.

"taco" was OK, tbh just tasted like regular taco bell taco as would expect.

"burrito" was above expectations. quite good. better than what could find in united states taco bell i believe. good taste and texture. i dont actually know what was in it but it tasted good.

after finishing taco bell i strolled around tokyo dome area doing not much in particular. i remember, i witnessed a human-pigeon interaction, whereby a pigeon for some reason really wanted to get inside some kind of shop. idrk why. i think the shop contained like.. indoor soccer? and probably other things but i dont know. and pigeon kept like.. walking towards into the entrance. and the human worker was dont want them to enter. and thus they move to block their entrance. so it was back-and-forth of one move, the other move, etc. is there a name for this? "game of chicken"? idrk know. its like when you move to get out of someones way when walking but they also move to get out of your way and you end up moving same direction. except on purpose. and they kept doing this. until pigeon walk away. and human retreat as well. but then pigeon literally just flew into shop and then human chased them out. and pigeon left for good, probably. that was fun.

and i sat on a bench, and then walked around more. and then went to a seven-eleven to pick up concert tickets. the worker at seven eleven was not japanese as well i believe. convenience store workers population is disproportionately not japanese for the very japanese population that lives in japan it seems btw. anyways i walked up and said "uhh chigetto" or something showing my confirmation thing on my phone and then they pressed some numbers into the thing and printed tickets and i said one more and they did it again and now i got all my tickets and all was good.

then idrked what to do because i had done everything on my to-do list. decided: perhaps go to imperial garden palace? or whatever that green spot is in the middle of tokyo. google maps said its free?. so i went there. and after reaching some kind of entrance i see theres a bag check uh oh!. hmm. i decide turn around because its kinda weird ppl going through ur entire belongings. and also tbh my bag was kinda heavy my neck back kinda hurt, i kinda wanted to drop off in a coin locker or something and then maybe go to palace, garden with just a small bag.

so i turned back walk back to train station, but then i doubted coin lockers was there, and was also kinda tired, so decided: hmm, maybe no imperial something. and then i accidentally walked to tokyo station unknowingly. and then i thought: hmm, maybe i should try to get an IC card. because many "coin locker" actually is just "IC card locker" and you have to use IC card to lock unlock locker. and trains slightly cheaper and easier to simply use IC card.

I saw somewheres online the major stations likely have IC card vending, or selling, or something. so looked around tokyo station. they had one vending which said it dont selling suica (ic card). how unfortunate. i read that can probably go to JR EAST TRAVEL INFO CENTRE or so and ask them sell you. but, idk where that was in tokyo station. and so i decided to go to shinjuku. why? probably because i thought shinjuku station bigger, more likely to have everything.

so i arrived shinjuku station. they vending machine also say do not sell suica (ic card). and so (with trouble) i found myself to the JR EAST TRAVEL CENTRE or so and then walked through the little maze of those retractable line-forming post thingies and arrived at the person and i say to them "do you have IC ca-do" and then they sayed approx "why yes we do. here is a sheet containing different prices which do you want (JPY2000 = JPY500 is the actual card + loaded with JPY1500)" or something like that and so i bought JPY2000 handed them the cash they disappeared for a while came back with the card gave it to me goodbye! and i left. and thats it now i got my very own IC card.

And then i used my new IC card by trying out a "coin" locker. however my backpack was too fat and could not fit in cheapest locker and so i wasted JPY300. so put my stuff in a locker one size up and then went for a stroll.

I had already made my mind up what dinner i wanted. in tokyo station i had passed by a place specializing in [chaduke](茶漬け) which sounded nice (and had kiosk, and english signage i saw, i believe). and i looked up and they had a branch at shinjuku. so i decided to go there for dinner. however it was now approx 3pm not time for dinner yet. so i strolled around shinjuku station area.

among other things i came across an IKEA which had

- PAPER TOWELS IN THEIR BATHROOM (rare find in japan)

- ice cream cone for 50 yen (i didnt buy one but it looked good)

at 15:59 in my notes i recorded that i was bored and was simply sitting on some random metal tube-bench-thing using phone not knowing what to do. I contemplated finding a convenience store and buying pocket tissues because my nose was running. However i then walked towards into shinjuku station where i found a bathroom in which i found toilet paper (which i forgot existed) and so i simply used toilet paper to blow my nose.

And then i wandered around shinjuku station. First in order to find the restaurant i intended to eat dinner. And then i found it, and then i wandered around more and got lost and could not find my way back to restaurant. but eventually did after many walking. and so arrived at the CHADUKE restaurant.

tbh it was sort of intimidating because there was no english signage here (the one in tokyo station had a big sign that was like "HEALTHY JAPANESE FAST FOOD" or so). and also on the kiosk there was a sign that said sth about credit cards. but i only understood that it was about credit cards. idk did it mean like, credit card not accepted? credit card only? credit card what??. so i pressed the buttons on kiosk (there was english i believe) and then payed with cash bc seemed safer.

and i was collecting my change from the machine when a worker on standby or so popped out of nowhere (actually they were probably just standing there waiting) and literally took my ticket from the machine for me and said sth like "[take a seat bro](お席にどうぞ)" so i took one and they disappeared. and then someone (probably them also?) appeared give cup of water. and disappeared. and then someone come out give the food. and i think they probably said something along the lines of "pour it urself have a nice meal"? and disappeared.

i did not know whether this was place with dish return. so i watched carefully see what other patrons do. and someone got up looks like they going. and they say i believe "dish return?" and staff replied im guessing sth like just leave it np. and they did so i believe. so , i believed it was NO DISH RETURN. and so i finished my meal, and left.

![train](20240625_180152.jpg)

took train to akihabara where the hotel of tonight was located. it was a small street off of the very big street thing. as usual the area had a lot of solicitors dressed in costumes i am not actually sure what they are soliciting. arrive in hotel which blended very so well with the surroundings that i accidentally walked past it by accident and could not find it for a while i believe.

same brand hotel again. same experience. same ritual of wash, arrange bag , use phone whatever with tv playing in background. go to sleep.

you do order the food on kiosk (which had an english option) which is located at your seating (i sat at counter). and then just wait, and then eventually the person brings your food to your place. There was literally only one worker in the entire shop i think doing cooking and everything it seemed at this time??. and i saw some google reviews mention same thing only one person. oops!.

There was no dish return to my observations. and but even though you order through kiosk, you do not actually pay through kiosk. to pay , after you ate done, walk out to entrance, where the single worker will come over and process your payment. i trailed behind another person paying so i would not have to try to call worker over by myself.

then i found way over to tokyo dome in order to umm like.. i think like pick up goods?. there was an online reservation thing to purchase fan goods on the day of concert that opened at 9am and by like 9:10 almost everything had sold out. which was i guess fine with me since i had indecision and wasnt really sure if wanted to buy anything. However i did intend to buy NewJeans fanlight, which did not sell out so i reserved, and arrived at tokyo dome.

I was "group 5 pickup" and they started with group 1, and seem quite long wait. so i just wander around. it was pretty bustling.

there was like a thing where you can pick up free lanyard and things so i did that. and then i dropped off my big bag of heavier posessions (clothes, toothbrush, charger, etc.) in a coin locker near the dome just carry around relevant possessions in a smaller secondary bag, and then i left the dome area and went to shibuya (like a 20-30 min train ride).

in shibuya visited line friends square or so store because from today it was newjeans popup. however by at this time, it seemed they had resorted to give everyone Numbered Tickets in order to enter the store, and they had stopped giving out Numbered Tickets. i.e. nobody can enter store unless had numbered ticket. though i think i literally saw someone just go in on accident(?) while the person wasnt looking had their back turned but anyways.

so i left in search of food. and i came across matsuya and i like matsuya so i went inside. however there was a lot of people like store is actually possibly entirely full full. so i was probably gonna leave but a worker said sth that i think was maybe like "theres some free seats" (? (or maybe "soon free seat")) probably?. so i placed an order on the kiosk.

This was a new matsuya experience for me in that entire store was only a large counter. and the worker takes the ticket from you and like puts the small half in a holder or sth at your spot on counter. and then you wait, and then they hand u ur food over the counter. and there is no dish return i think?. or at least nobody was returning they dishes.

it was cool, though tbh i probably only mentally managed to get through the experience because the store was so crowded and also there was so many fellow tourists so i felt like i just going with crowd or sth i think.

as a side-note, to my left on the counter was i think assume think a tourist and they small child, who was eating i think a cheese tonkatsu or something similar.

and to my right was someone i believe ordered through matsuya mobile app? and had to show order to staff n stuff.

i finished meal left. idked what to do next. i think try to go to the imperial palace gardens things again. so i went there. however i could not actually find an entrance? one of the entrances seemed to be closed or so. so walked along the perimeter trying look for next entrance or sth.

along the way i walked through some sort of mini park(s) on the perimeter and encountered, used a public restroom. and in the toilet stall i encountered this strange fuzzy pink toilet seat thing??

![?](20240626_134827.jpg)

which i am not actually sure function of. a kids seat? or just for comfort or so? not sure. but the bathroom was nice.

after walking for a long while next to car roads and stuff, occasionally stopping and sat down and booked hotel for the night, arrived at some kind of entrance for something that idrked. seemed to be some kind of garden. so i went in following along the car roads again i did seem to arrive in some kind of garden. in which i explored for like 20 mins or so, sat on a bench also and then left.

![i took this singular picture](20240626_143943.jpg)

then i went.. to hotel. and checked in. it was actually exact same hotel as day before yesterday , the one that gave free alcohol sample. i think it was also same person that checked me in. though they did not give me free alcohol this time. they just gave me some kind of coupon can check in early if book directly through the hotel or sth? not really sure.

iirc my room smelled vaguely like smoke which idk why but whatever. i took shower, and then approx 30-min nap, and then time to leave for concert.

arrive at tokyo dome. at the convenience store outside station i arrived at, i bought two balls of rice and mini bottle of tea and hand cream because my feet bottom was cracked kinda painful. strolled over to tokyo dome ate the non-handcream items at some outdoor table.

and went to goods-pickup and discovered that since i was "group 5" goods reservation i literally had to be there when they was serving group-5 people otherwise they cancel my order. however it was no longer group 5 and no longer taking orders, so i had no fanlight.

so went to enter the dome. at the bag check the person doing bag check said sth in japanese to me that i didnt know. retrospectively i think it was "can i put my hands inside ur bag in order to check its stuff", but i had no clue in the moment and just acted confused and they were approx like "ok its fine bro lol you can go" and i went.

they gave free biscuits and nice little piece of cardboard and sticker n stuff enter the dome. and i found seat and waited.

![people filling in seats](20240626_181218.jpg)

and eventually concert started. recording, photography prohibited though some ppl did some sneak some in i believe but i figured not rlly worth and so simply tried to be present, which yeah idk, idrk.

the concert was umm 2 and a half hours i believe? and idrk how else to describe it except that it happened. tbh the crowd felt kinda dead? where i was sitting? perhaps. though went noticeably crazy in some moments e.g. guest (yoasobi) performance, and "aoi sangoshou" song performance.

eventually concert ended and left with very umm.. empty? post-concert depression? life depression? sort of feelings, like desire to go live in mountains feeling? placed too much importance on something and realize life is still same feeling? not really sure feelings, but probably depressing feelings.

however i got to go through the "strong winds up to 45mph" door exiting tokyo dome (doorway with strong winds up to 45 mph) which was fun. and then i followed the giant crowd out of tokyo dome but had to find my way back to get my primary bag from coin locker.

And i was sort of hungry so i stopped by a convenience store bought a sandwich and barley tea (self register) and just sat outside store ate it in what i recall a very depressing manner.

and then a person i knew online found/knew someone with intent to go, and they also say know someone else who could perhaps go. EXCEPT they end up cannot go? and idk if their friend go either? AND SO they sent replacement people which are, i believe, ppl they knew from online as well?

And thus it essentially became, i am going to concert with two online acquaintences of online acquaintence of online acquainteince? essentially. interesting.

it was decided (night before and morning) meet at some italian restaurant. tbh i wanted to go to dennys because going to dennys with two strangers from internet sounds funny yeah but we didnt go to a dennys or any family restaurant went to some fancyish italian-japanese? restaurant for meeting.

oh except we stopped beforehand to get some newjeans newspapers. and then found way to restaurant.

the restaurant was quite an experience we got seated at big corner booth thingy? and the menu was this giant board or something. and they also gave us hot wet towels. and paper apron things.

# italian?-japanese food with strangers

![foods](20240627_135358.jpg)

all of us ordered from i think like some weekly special or recommended or idrk the small menu board thing. two of us ordered beef steak and one ordered pork-loin tonkatsu i believe. according to google review the selling point of restaurant was actually sth like special menu inspired by japanese cartoon or sth. but i dont think got any of that. oh well.

the food was honestly...... imo i didnt really like it i think. steak was umm.. idk maybe its japanese style or sth but not seared basically at all and im not sure why u would prepare it like that? the side dishes were ok i think?. the miso soup(i think it was?) tasted pretty ok to me, though two others said it was very salty for them i think. it was overall just kind of meh i think. i also ate the last slice of tonkatsu bc person wasnt gonna eat it they said and it was cold but also.. yeah idk not particularly fantastic imo. also now that i think abt it, i finished the leftover (basically all) rice of one person and that last slice of tonkatsu and rice from other person but i wonder if that was kinda weird like especially its first-meeting cross-culture exchange and opposite gender, i wonder if that was weird. oh well!.

each dish was i think sth like JPY2000 iirc but imo the actual value was probably mostly just the atmosphere or experience or so, like to call waiter you ring the bell or sth which is funny. and the wet towels and whatever. thus i will give this place relatively low taste score but high experience score because i dont think i will ever have experience like this again in life probably (idk).

meal was quite the experience bc it is not every day that you meet online strangers in opposite time zone from home in country foreign to all parties. chat about um.. newjeans, and college (they was college students i believe) main topics i think. they was korean but communicate in english to me because i believe i was established as american and probably dont know much korean anyways, though i could understand whatever they said amongst themselves sometimes. as usual in group settings , i was the one doing the least talking and they was quite extroverted i believe talk many.

i was humbled and impressed by their fan credentials like one went to several many of the music show recordings, even had the sunglasses i saw once on instagram that was gifted at out one recording. and the other literally like design and manufactured a fan goods and also went to an actual irl fansign i believe. very crazy.

after lunch, went back to tokyo dome where they went to pick up some stuff in the thing, and then i lost them in the crowd, and we decided to just meet in the actual concert seats bc they already had tickets now.

i went to shibuya bc it was after 12:30 to check on the line friends. there was a line, but apparently the closed the relevant part of the store so i left went back to tokyo dome. except i got off at wrong stop again, and so i half run walk back to tokyo dome bc i was afraid about to miss a goods pickup. fortunately did not miss, purchased fanlight, entered the dome, wait for concert.

tbh i was slightly worried oops should i have entered with them bc i think thats what the fine text said somewhere. but nobody rlly checked name on my ticket or anything so assumed would be fine. and they was fine.

concert came and went. crowd felt more alive where sitting this time. was inexplicably more sad this time like idk why. except there was crying involved in the concert so that is kind of sad. but also i felt sort of like i had lost something or so. not really sure.

must have been sort of suboptimal for two friends also im guessing. bc they had like brought/comissioned cheering goods like umm.. slogan? like that thing you hold up thats like a sign essentially or anyways. but we were in bottom-tier seats, though to be fair pretty OK bottom-tier seats (except there was a giant pole in front of us that often could obstruct view i believe). but only time these items were even slightly relevant was the performance involving moving carts, but seats were situated in such away that kind of close but not close at all, so.. unfortunate.

concert was soon ended. the two people no longer talked or communicated to me. was talking abt what to eat (in korean amongst themselves) and i sort of just followed them out for a while wondering if i should say something, until was got to like the streets and there was no acknowledgement of my existence so i silently parted ways. tbh i think i gained a new trauma by this no-goodbye no-acknowledgement-of-existence parting of ways, but to be fair i didnt say goodbye or anything either except later via text bc i felt if i didnt the trauma would go too deep

i think i took train to akihabara station, and i went to a mcdonalds, but it looked pretty busy or sth so i just left and walked down to kanda where this nights hotel was situated. on way i passed by a convenience, which actually i had always seen and sorta wanted to go into (daily yamazaki). and i passed by it. but then turned back bc i saw it had a self register i believe.

i bought cup noodles and meal box and self-registered (iirc there was unfortunately no english in the self-register??) and walked to hotel.

check in hotel and then warmed up, hydrated convenience foods ate it depressedly with my new post-concert depression (x2) and social anxiety trauma with the tv on in background. i did not buy any drink but i drank water from the tap, which, though not labelled (often is labelled in hotel rooms) as drinkable i assumed was drinkable.

the curry noodles was ok. the meal box had chicken which i didnt particularly like. i was very tired and also depressed and traumatized i think so everything also tasted worse probably.

and then i went to tokyo station where buy shinkansen ticket for osaka. except for some reason i could only buy the seat or sth not fare? and i was confused. so i went over to the person counter and said "can I shinoosaka" or so and they said do u have ticket? no. sth else? no. ic card? oh yeah i have ic card and i gave. and somehow they purchased me a fare ticket but i needed that ic card i have no clue why. (FARE: JPY8910, SEAT: JPY4960)

sat on train for osaka. guy that sat in seat next (next) to me brought his entire like computer laptop and everything chargers setup or sth quite large.

![this was pulling into nagoya i believe](20240628_120929.jpg)

just did whatever on phone on train probably like booked hotel or sth. i also remember now that i looked at sake tasting places bc i wanted to consume some CNS depressant. but end up i never went.

eventually arrived osaka which was felt like flooded with tourists. idrked what to do except eat. and idrked what to eat. i thought maybe go try "mos burger" bc saw often looked interesting. looked one navigating to it when i saw some kind of curry? place with kiosk and looked good, so instead just went in there.

i think that place is actually like a spinoff of matsuya?. the experience was same except the menu was just different. they even played the same like announcements i think.

then i left and um idked what to do i like walked around and into some park it was sort of raining on and off and i saw some wet pigeons and not much else.

![saw this empty large plastic container of whiskey or sth](20240628_143309.jpg)

![wet pigeons](20240628_145343.jpg)

i didnt know what else to do and so i went to check in to hotel i figured i leave stuff there and then go out again idk.

at the checkin the guy that checked me in explained stuff to me in english in such a way that felt super "english" but also super "japanese" at the same time, like i imagine if i was japanese that knew none english i would be convinced that this guy was legendary fluent english speaker, but at the same time as nonjapanese i could understand him less than just regular japanese person speaking english.

this hotel was new different brand had never used, seemed like local not very big chain brand (but still had ton of tourists). my key was physical actual key not like a keycard. and they said u had to leave key at the front desk if going out?!.

i lied on that bed tiny strip thing and took a short nap with the tv on. and when i awoke i thought about what to do and concluded i didnt really want to do anything and it was not worth the effort of leaving room leaving key at front etc., so i washed up and then watched tv until going to sleep with no dinner.

# aside: future lemon sour
one thing i saw on TV was this segment talking abt asahi future lemon sour which is highball with wide-mouth can and also a lemon slice contained in the drink?!.

but only pre-released or sth in tokyo area?! which was unfortunate bc i literally just left there.

but i really wanted to drink that when i saw it it looked so neat.

::: aside
# aside: japanese TV
japanese TV was is sort of a comfort for me in japan travels. it was filled with all kind of mildly interesting things that can keep ur attention. i imagine it is like scrolling through tiktok, if that was TV. it was a comfort to simply turn on tv at end of day or something no matter what happened and let my brain rot for a bit, ferment a little. some background noise as wrapping up the day.

::: aside
# aside: what side of the sidewalk to people walk on? in japan and stuff

i would say that in united states, mostly people walk on the right-hand side of sidewalks n stuff whatever. and also drive on right side of road.

However japan drive on left side of road. so does ppl walk on left-hand side of sidewalk??.

the answer is: i have no clue. in my experience people walk on left, middle, right. there is no fixed. in train stations there are usually arrows telling u what side to walk on, and sometimes it is left, sometimes it is right.

However, in tokyo people always stood on left side of elevator, to allow ppl to walk up on right side.

But when arrived in osaka this pattern was reversed and ppl stand right, walk left. Why? idk. but the sidewalk walking still no clear pattern imo ppl walking all over the place.

# day 9 (japan)

i woke up this day and didnt rlly feel like doing anything still, likely still depressed. it was last day of existing in japan. watched the tv and did nothing until like 10am finally leave. decide to go to "Wakayama" or at least that area bc looked like had beaches.

![some kinda nankai line train i beliveeve](20240629_104535.mp4)

take trains. on train, search food on phone. some ramen place comes up on google with good reviews and ppl praising saying locals love it! n stuff idrk. so decide go there.

![line](20240629_120254.jpg)

um there was line for lunch. im guessing many of the ppl were japanese tourists? like some had backpacks, one was like taking pictures. though honestly i have no idea.

i was ready to try to order in japanese but when my turn came person immediately figured me out "english?" gave me english menu thanks. and all i did order was point hold up 1 finger to indicate "give me one pls".

# first non-instant ramen i have eaten in japan

ordered [中華そば](ramen) (JPY950) and [ライス](rice) (JPY150). idk if i was missing something, have not developed a taste for ramen, but honestly did not taste great like would rather eat ramen ive had in united states. what i will say is it did taste like um.. homemade? like someone actually maybe made it instead of from pre-manufactured stuff.

inside the restaurant there was many tables n stuff but actually there was only like 1 or 2 persons per table even if table was like 4x4. it did seem like the production of food was the main limiting factor.

got, ate food. got up with money ready. person tell me the price, but in japanese. luckily i already calculated and thought of what the price would be in japanese so i was mentally prepared for understanding. hand them money, leave.

i was looking at bus schedule and bus pulled up. i saw it was 25 bus and i probably needed to get on 4 bus but i was standing in such a way that i knew it looked like i wanted to ride and thus i felt the obligation to ride the bus even know i knew it was probably the wrong bus. anyways i got off a few stops later which seemed like i could transfer to the bus i needed. but it already passed the bus i saw on google maps. thus i wait for 20 minutes for a different bus that google maps says can take me.

took train to KIX. bought some stuff that father requested. checked in flight with some kiosk. went through security, and also to declare(?) or idk what? tax-free? something? idk goods (binoculars, and stuff i bought for dad) i scanned my passport at this machine that did i have no clue what? but i scanned my passport and it said OK i think so i went on.

found my way to my gate which was near the convenience store i got sushi from last week. and so i picked out some beer and waited in line (the line was quite long) pick out sushi and watermelon check out.

I also noticed there was a self register nobody was using, and even a sign saying "there is a self register", but written only in japanese. but i had alcohol so could not self.

i got my food and was ready to have best meal of my life

# Canada (Vancouver)

arrived at vancouver airport. the layover is 12 hours so i decide go through immigration go around the area.

there was just some kind of kiosk thing u press buttons go through. and got through.

I exchanged 40 USD to CAD just in case or idk, neat to get new currency. the money was plasticky and shiny. also i got a pretty bad exchange rate i think.

And then i exit airport and follow signs for train. train go to "Downtown vancounver" it say. you could pay the train with tap credit card, which is what i did.

rode train for a while. train tbh felt slightly like an amusement park ride more than like an actual train, similar feelings to san francisco train and washington DC train that i have ridden before. perhaps it is a mixture of the seating layout and the feel strangely empty even if theres people on it. not really sure.

arrive in sth like "vancouver city centre" where i got out and walked around. it was um, tbh not very impressive imo. it just felt like a suburban downtown with slightly more people walking around and slightly worse smells and more homeless people.

![PARK](TZ=Canada/Pacific:20240629_134757.jpg)

walked around a busy ish street looking for mcdonalds bc mcdonalds has special canada menu i believe want to eat that. But then came across a Jollibee which i wanted to try so i went in there. no kiosk or anything, just go up and order uhh can i get a blah blah blah blah etc.

Gived buzzer, wait for food. get food (i got to-go) and leave and walk towards what seemed to be a green area on google maps. However when i got there there was minimal greenery. it seemed to just be some college area and they was having some kind of demonstration so i walked further down to see if there was any some sort of park.

I did not find any but i found some stairs i saw some other persons was sitting so i sat there and ate my jollibee food.

I got 2pc meal deal which include:

- 2 pieces chicken (with gravy)
- a regular side (i chose fries)
- soda (i chose 7-up)
- peach mango pie

the chicken was quite good, though quite flavorful kinda salty. the pieces given were thigh and leg which is good. i tried with and without gravy, um its already kinda so flavorful and salty that tbh gravy doesnt make any impact imo. though i think this would actually taste rlly good with rice i sort of wish i had gotten the rice or mashed potatoes other sides i think wouldve been very good.

fries was good too. peach mango pie taste like umm.. about what it looks like. fried pie pastry with peach mango flavor filling.

finished up. wandered around vaguely back towards train station that i came from. passed by mcdonalds (did not go in) and hmart (went in for like 3 mins) and then enter back into train station. i used a bathroom in a mall connected to the train station and i remember the toilet stall was pleasantly warm. the vancouver outside temperature was tbh not too warm. not cold either but not warm.

then i just went back to airport bc there was rlly nothing i wanted to do or see. so i went to airport.

My boarding pass for flight to USA did not have a gate listed so i tried to re-check-in with kiosk but didnt work. i asked someone about it and they said yeah um you just have to check when ur past security. and all USA flights are in this area thing. but its a long time to ur flight u wanna go in now??.

and so i went in anyways. i drank essentially my entire irohas water at the security checkpoint and then went through and whatever.

And then i just sat around in the gates for like 5 hours using phone. it was cold. for dinner i ate at a tim hortons which didnt have chili or a self-order kiosk.

this flight i mostly just slept which was nice. i used mouth mask as eye mask. at some point i woke up and i had dropped my glasses on ground, and also the screens on the back of the chair was very bright. i was like trying to press the screen or whatever wth how do turn the screen off and the person next to me was like "excuse me, um [i dont actually remember]" but they pulled down the arm thingy next to me and the controls were there. thanks person next to me!.

There was one snack served during the flight i think but i didnt want, just remained mask over eyes.

Eventually, arrived. this concludes trip.

# CONCLUSIONS

on the flight from toronto to japan i watched that movie "parasite" and one if the lines was something like "if you dont have plan, nothing can go wrong". This roughly describes my life and also this trip i just took. Nothing went wrong, and conversely nothing went right either. Tbh even though it didnt have any plan it felt like a flop. why? maybe because i became healthily ill for majority of trip, or spent entire week adjusting to time zone, or gained depression, or social anxiety trauma.

However perhaps it was not a flop. i successfully rode a bus, and ordered food at a restaurant, and went through customs that one time, and ate meals with friend, and that mala curry tonkatsu was really good.

Maybe it was a learning experience. faced with new stimuli and stuff my mind will be forced to take in everything and form new brain neuron connection things and thus gain a greater understanding of the world or something.

However, most likely idk. Was it fun? idk. Would i have done it if i knew exactly how it would go? idk. In summary, idk and it is over. so maybe it will continue digesting in my unconscious and i will grow as a person, or maybe that wont happen and this week and a half of my life will be forever remembered as a flop. there were too many small details experienced that was not recorded here, perhaps not even in my conscious memory to understood what actually happened or how it would affect a small human being such as myself. However that sushi at kansai international airport with beer was really good. the end.
